👋 Hey there, I'm Mekonius! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

👀 I'm interested in all things tech and programming, but I'm also a huge fan of video games, music, and food. 🎮 🎵 🍔

🌱 I'm currently learning new programming languages and tools to expand my skills and knowledge. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

💻 In my spare time, I love working on side projects and collaborating with others. If you have a cool idea or project you'd like to work on together, let's chat!

📫 You can reach me on Twitter (@Mekonius) or by sending me a message here on GitHub. Let's connect and build something awesome! 🚀
